  DOCTYPE tells the browser to render in "standards mode".

  <!-- ── FONTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    We load Roboto from Google Fonts. Two <link> tags are used:
    1. rel="preconnect" — tells the browser to open a connection
       to fonts.googleapis.com early, before it even starts
       downloading the font. This speeds up the font load.
    2. The second link is the actual font stylesheet URL.
       We request the weights (300, 400, 700, 900) and the italic
       style (ital) that we need. Requesting only what you use
       keeps the page faster.

  <!-- ── STYLESHEET ────────────────────────────────────────────
    This links our external CSS file. rel="stylesheet" tells the
    browser what kind of file it is. href is the path — because
    styles.css is in the same folder as index.html, we just write
    the filename. No inline styles anywhere in this HTML file.

<body>
  <!--
    Everything inside <body> is what the user actually sees.
    We divide the page into semantic sections that match the design:
      1. <header>         — logo + navigation
      2. <section.hero>   — big intro block
      3. <section.info>   — four info cards
      4. <section.quote>  — testimonial / quote
      5. <section.cta>    — call-to-action card
      6. <footer>         — copyright
  -->


  <!-- ============================================================
    HEADER
    We use the semantic <header> element (not a <div>) because it
    communicates meaning — it tells the browser, screen readers,
    and search engines "this is the page header".

    Inside it, <nav> is the semantic element for navigation.
    Same idea — prefer meaningful elements over generic <div>s
    whenever possible. This is called "semantic HTML".
  ============================================================ -->
  <header>
    <!--
      The <nav> gets the "container" class. That class is defined
      in our CSS to centre content and cap its max-width. By putting
      it on the <nav> itself (rather than wrapping it in another div),
      we avoid adding an extra unnecessary element.
    -->
    <nav class="container">

      <!--
        <span> is an inline element used here for the logo text.
        We use <span> instead of <h1> because the logo is not a
        page heading — it's a brand label. <h1> should be reserved
        for the most important heading on the page (the hero heading).
        Semantic headings matter for accessibility and SEO.
      -->
      <span class="logo">Header Logo</span>

      <!--
        <ul> (unordered list) is the correct element for navigation
        links because a nav is conceptually a list of links — it has
        no meaningful order. Screen readers announce lists, which
        helps users understand the page structure.

        Each link is wrapped in <li> (list item), which is required
        as a direct child of <ul>. The actual clickable link is <a>.
        href="#" is a placeholder — in a real site this would be
        a real URL like "/about" or "/contact".
      -->
      <ul class="nav-links">
        <li><a href="#">header link one</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">header link two</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">header link three</a></li>
      </ul>

    </nav>

  <!-- ============================================================
    HERO SECTION
    <section> is a semantic element for a standalone thematic block.
    Use it when a chunk of content could stand on its own with a
    heading. The "hero" is the big attention-grabbing block at the
    very top of the page.
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="hero">
    <!--
      .hero-inner also gets the "container" class. Two classes on
      one element is totally fine — "hero-inner" handles the flex
      layout between text and image, while "container" handles the
      centring and max-width. Combining classes like this keeps each
      class focused on one job (separation of concerns).

          This website has some subtext that goes here under the main title.
          It's a smaller font and the color is lower contrast.

        <!--
          We use an <a> (anchor) tag styled to look like a button,
          rather than an actual <button> element. The rule of thumb:
            - Use <button> for actions that happen on the same page
              (e.g. submitting a form, opening a modal).
            - Use <a> for navigation — links that take you somewhere.
          Since "Sign up" would take you to a signup page, <a> is
          the right choice here.
