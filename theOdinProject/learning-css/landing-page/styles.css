   HOW THIS FILE IS ORGANISED
   Reading order matters in CSS — rules that come later can
   override rules that came earlier. We structure this file
   from most general (reset, globals) to most specific (sections).

     3.  Base / Global Styles

/* ============================================================
   1. CSS RESET

   Problem: every browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) ships with
   its own default stylesheet. That means <h1> tags might be
   slightly different sizes, <ul> lists might have different
   padding, and so on. This causes inconsistent layouts across
   browsers.

   Solution: the reset below strips those defaults so we start
   with a blank, consistent slate across all browsers.

   The * selector means "select every single element on the page".
   *::before and *::after catch pseudo-elements too.
============================================================ */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  /* 
    box-sizing: border-box changes how width and height are calculated.

    DEFAULT (content-box): width = content only. If you set width: 200px
    and add padding: 20px, the element becomes 240px wide. Confusing!

    border-box: width = content + padding + border combined. So
    width: 200px stays 200px no matter what padding you add. 
    This is almost always what you actually want.
  */
  box-sizing: border-box;

  /*
    Browsers add default margin/padding to many elements.
    For example, <body> has an 8px margin, <h1> has top/bottom margin,
    <ul> has left padding for the bullets, etc.
    
    Setting both to 0 here removes all of those defaults. We then
    add back only the spacing we actually want, where we want it.
  */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}


/* ============================================================
   2. CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES (VARIABLES)

   Custom properties (also called CSS variables) let you define
   a value once and reuse it everywhere with var(--name).

   Why use them?
     - If the brand blue changes, you update ONE line instead of
       hunting through the whole stylesheet.
     - It documents your design system — someone reading the file
       immediately sees all the colours and sizes in one place.
     - They make your CSS consistent — you can't accidentally use
       #3882f6 in one place and #3882F6 in another.

   :root is a special selector that refers to the <html> element.
   Variables defined here are available everywhere in the stylesheet.
============================================================ */
:root {

  /* ── COLOURS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Named by their ROLE (what they're for), not their appearance.
    "color-dark-bg" is better than "color-navy" because if you
    change the shade, the name still makes sense.
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
  --color-dark-bg:      #1F2937;  /* header, hero, footer background */
  --color-light-bg:     #FFFFFF;  /* info & CTA section background */
  --color-quote-bg:     #E5E7EB;  /* quote section background */
  --color-accent:       #3882F6;  /* buttons & CTA card — the brand blue */

  --color-hero-heading: #F9FAF8;  /* near-white — main hero h1 */
  --color-hero-sub:     #E5E7EB;  /* light grey — hero paragraph & nav links */
  --color-body:         #1F2937;  /* near-black — text on white backgrounds */
  --color-muted:        #6B7280;  /* mid-grey — card subtext, placeholders */

  /* ── FONT SIZES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    Taken directly from the design spec image. Centralising them
    here means if the design changes, you update one number.
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
  --fs-logo:     24px;  /* header logo */
  --fs-nav:      18px;  /* nav links */
  --fs-hero-h1:  48px;  /* "This website is awesome" */
  --fs-hero-sub: 18px;  /* hero paragraph */
  --fs-info-h2:  36px;  /* "Some random information." */
  --fs-quote:    36px;  /* blockquote text */
  --fs-body:     16px;  /* default body text */

  /* ── LAYOUT ───────────────────────────────────────────────── */
  --max-width: 960px;
  /*
    960px is the max content width. On screens wider than this,
    the content stops growing and sits centred. This prevents
    paragraphs from becoming uncomfortably wide on large monitors.
    The .container class (below) uses this variable.
  */
}


/* ============================================================
   3. BASE / GLOBAL STYLES

   These rules apply to broad elements (body, a) and set sensible
   defaults that cascade down to every element on the page.
   CSS "cascades" — child elements inherit styles from parents,
   which is why setting font-family on body affects everything inside it.
============================================================ */
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  /*
    'Roboto' is the font we loaded from Google Fonts.
    'sans-serif' is the fallback — if Roboto fails to load for any
    reason (no internet, typo in font URL, etc.), the browser uses
    its default sans-serif font instead of an ugly serif font.
    Always include a generic fallback.
  */

  font-size: var(--fs-body);
  /*
    Setting a base font-size on body means all text inherits this
    as a starting point. We only need to override it on elements
    that need a different size.
  */

  color: var(--color-body);
  /*
    Setting color here means all text on the page defaults to
    our near-black. We override it with lighter colours where
    elements sit on dark backgrounds.
  */

  line-height: 1.5;
  /*
    line-height controls the vertical space between lines of text.
    1.5 means 1.5× the font size — so at 16px font, lines are 24px
    apart. This is the recommended default for body text readability.
    A unitless value (1.5 vs 1.5px) scales proportionally if the
    font size changes, which is why unitless is preferred here.
  */
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
  /*
    By default, browsers underline all links and colour them blue.
    We strip that here because our design styles links differently.
    We re-add underlines only where the design calls for it
    (e.g. on hover in the nav).
  */
}


/* ============================================================
   4. UTILITY: .container

   A "utility class" is a small, reusable CSS class with a single
   job. .container's job is: centre content and limit its width.

   We apply it to many different elements throughout the HTML —
   this is much better than writing the same centring code over
   and over for each section.
============================================================ */
.container {
  max-width: var(--max-width);

  /*
    The element won't grow wider than 960px. On smaller screens,
    it shrinks to fill the available width automatically.
  */

  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  /*
    Setting left AND right margins to "auto" is the classic CSS
    trick for horizontal centring of block elements. The browser
    divides the remaining space equally on both sides.
    
    This only works on block-level elements (div, section, etc.)
    that have a defined width (or max-width).
  */

  padding-left: 24px;
  padding-right: 24px;
  /*
    This padding ensures content never touches the very edge of the
    screen on narrow viewports. Think of it as "breathing room"
    on the sides. Without it, text would be flush against the
    phone screen edge on small devices.
  */
}


/* ============================================================
   5. BUTTONS

   The two buttons on this page (hero and CTA) look different from
   each other, but share a lot of base styling. We write the shared
   styles in .btn once, then create .btn-outline as a modifier that
   overrides only what needs to change.

   In HTML: class="btn"              → filled blue button
            class="btn btn-outline"  → transparent/ghost button

   This "base + modifier" pattern avoids duplication and is one
   of the most important patterns in CSS.
============================================================ */
.btn {
  display: inline-block;
  /*
    <a> tags are inline elements by default, meaning you can't
    set width/height or top/bottom padding on them reliably.
    inline-block makes the element behave like a block (so padding
    works correctly) while still sitting inline with surrounding text.
  */

  background-color: var(--color-accent);  /* blue fill */
  color: #ffffff;

  font-family: inherit;
  /*
    Buttons and inputs don't automatically inherit the font from body —
    this is one of those browser quirks. "inherit" forces them to use
    the same font as everything else (Roboto).
  */

  font-size: var(--fs-body);
  font-weight: 700;

  padding: 10px 24px;
  /*
    Shorthand: padding: [top/bottom] [left/right]
    10px top and bottom, 24px left and right.
    This gives the button a "pill-like" comfortable click area.
  */

  border: 2px solid var(--color-accent);
  /*
    We set a border even on the filled button so that the
    .btn-outline modifier only needs to change the color — the
    border size is already there. Without this, the outline button
    would cause layout shift when the border appeared.
  */

  border-radius: 6px;   /* softly rounded corners */
  cursor: pointer;      /* shows the hand cursor on hover */
}

.btn:hover {
  /*
    :hover is a "pseudo-class" — it applies styles only when the
    user's mouse is over the element. We use opacity to subtly dim
    the button, giving visual feedback that it's interactive.
  */
  opacity: 0.88;
}

/* ── MODIFIER: outline/ghost variant ─────────────────────────
   This class is ADDED alongside .btn, not instead of it.
   It only overrides the properties that differ from the base.
   Everything else (padding, border-radius, font, etc.) stays
   the same — we get all of that for free from .btn above.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
.btn-outline {
  background-color: transparent; /* clear fill — shows the card colour behind */
  border-color: #ffffff;         /* white border instead of blue */
  color: #ffffff;
}

  /*
    rgba() lets us use a colour with an alpha (transparency) channel.
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12) = white at 12% opacity.

    completely changing the button's appearance.

}


/* ============================================================
   6. HEADER

   The header sits at the top of every page. It has a dark
   background. Inside it, the <nav> uses flexbox to put the
   logo on the far left and the nav links on the far right.
============================================================ */
header {
  background-color: var(--color-dark-bg);
  padding: 16px 0;
  /*
    padding: 16px 0 means 16px top and bottom, 0 left and right.

    already has it via the .container class.

}

  /*
    Flexbox is a layout mode designed for one-dimensional layouts
    (a row OR a column). We use it here to put the logo and nav
    links on a single horizontal row.

    become "flex items" that the parent can position.

    justify-content controls how flex items are positioned along
    the main axis (horizontal, in a row).
    
    space-between: pushes the first item to the far left and the
    last item to the far right, with any remaining items evenly
    spaced in between. With two items (logo + ul), this puts
    the logo left and the links right — exactly what the design shows.

    Other values you'll use often:
      flex-start  — items packed to the left (default)
      flex-end    — items packed to the right
      center      — items centred
      space-around — equal space around each item
  */

  align-items: center;
  /*
    align-items controls positioning on the cross axis (vertical,
    when flex-direction is row). center makes the logo and nav
    links vertically centred with each other, even if they have
    different heights. Without this, they'd align to the top.

   7. HERO SECTION

   The hero has two columns side by side: text on the left,
